## Overview

The Hotel Reservation Application is a Java-based project that enables users to search for available hotel rooms, make reservations, and manage their bookings. This application demonstrates the use of fundamental Java programming concepts and object-oriented design principles.

## Features

### For Customers

- **Customer Registration**: The user needs to first create a customer account before they can create a reservation.
- **Room Search**: The app should allow the user to search for available rooms based on provided checkin and checkout dates. If the application has available rooms for the specified date range, a list of the corresponding rooms will be displayed to the user for choosing.
- **Room Booking**: Once the user has chosen a room, the app will allow them to book the room and create a reservation.
- **Reservation Management**: After booking a room, the app allows customers to view a list of all their reservations.

### For Admin

- **Room Management**: Add and view rooms.
- **View Reservations**: View all customer reservations.
- **View Customers**: View all registered customers.
  
## Project Structure

- **User Interface (UI)**: Includes a main menu for users who want to book a room, and an admin menu for administrative functions.
- **Resources**: Act as our Application Programming Interface (API) to our UI.
- **Services**: Communicate with our resources, and each other, to build the business logic necessary to provide feedback to our UI.
- **Data Models**: Used to represent the domain within the system (e.g., rooms, reservations, and customers).
